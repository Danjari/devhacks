# **Synapse Pathway Generator**

Welcome to **Synapse Pathway Generator**, a project we built for a hackathon at Columbia University, where we won **Second Place Overall and First place in Education**!

## **What This Project Is About**

This tool helps students learn complex subjects, like **Linear Algebra**, in a more personalized way. Instead of following the same lessons as everyone else, students can create their own learning path based on what they already know and what they want to learn.

## **The Problem We’re Solving**

Learning subjects like **Linear Algebra** can be tough. Most educational tools give everyone the same lessons, which might not fit what you already know or want to learn. We wanted to fix that by creating a tool that adjusts to each student’s needs.

## **How It Works**

1. **Tell Us What You Know**:  
   Students start by typing in what they already know about **Linear Algebra** and picking how they plan to use it (like for **Economics**, **Physics**, **Data Science**, etc.).

2. **Custom Learning Path**:  
   Our tool, powered by **AI**, takes that information and builds a custom path for learning. This path is made up of different steps, called **nodes**, which might be lessons, quizzes, or assignments.

3. **Interactive Learning Path**:  
   The path is displayed on the screen, where each step (or node) is connected to the next. Students can click on a node to:
   - **Learn Concepts**: Watch videos and read explanations.
   - **Take Quizzes**: Answer questions to make sure they understand.
   - **Do Assignments**: Complete exercises that match what they’ve learned.

4. **Feedback and Progress**:  
   As students answer questions correctly, they get immediate feedback. Once they complete a step, it turns grey to show that they’ve mastered that part and can move on.

## **What Makes This Tool Special**

- **Personalized Learning**: The path is created based on what the student knows and wants to learn.
- **Easy-to-Follow Steps**: Each step is clearly shown, with videos, quizzes, and assignments all in one place.
- **Immediate Feedback**: Students get instant feedback on their progress.
- **Track Your Learning**: Completed steps turn grey, so it’s easy to see what’s been done and what’s next.


## **Hackathon Win!**

This project was built as part of **Columbia DivHacks Hackathon**, and we’re excited to share that it won **First Place**! The judges loved how the tool helps students create their own learning journey.

## **What’s Next**

Here’s what we’re planning to do next:

- **More Personalization**: Make the tool even smarter by adding more customization options.
- **Add More Subjects**: Expand beyond **Linear Algebra** to other subjects, like **Data Science** or **Machine Learning**.
- **Collaborative Learning**: Allow students to work on learning paths together.
